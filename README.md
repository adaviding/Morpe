MoRPE:  A Probabilistic Classifier
=====
The classification problem is commonly encountered when a finite sample of data is leveraged to determine the probabilistic relationship between a category label  c  and a multivariate coordinate  "x"   for an entire population.  Solving this problem requires approximating the optimal classifier, a function of  "x"   that evaluates the conditional probability  p(c¦"x" )  in an optimal way.  This paper introduces MoRPE, a new method for approximating optimal classifiers.  MoRPE is a machine learning method for probabilistic classification based on Monotonic Regression of a Polynomial Expansion.  It is conceptually related to Fisher’s Quadratic Discriminant (Fisher 1936).  MoRPE has the ability to approximate an optimal classifier with remarkable precision in common scenarios.
